INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING CODE FOR HOMEWORK 3

CORY JEZ - MACHINE LEARNING - FALL 2018

There are two datasets used in this code:
1) NBA data
2) Wine Data

The NBA data is located in a CSV file which is also available in the github repo. You'll just need to point the path in 
the first function to import that CSV file correctly

The wine data is available from the sklearn datasets library

After that all code should run as long as you have required libraries installed. 

The code is located here: https://github.com/jezlax/georgiatech_ml and is hw3.py
